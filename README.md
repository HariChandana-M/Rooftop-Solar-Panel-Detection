# Rooftop-Solar-Panel-Detection
This project involves building a CNN model to classify satellite images for the presence of solar panels. The dataset consists of labeled images, with pixel values normalized for stable training. A sequential CNN architecture with multiple convolutional, pooling, and batch normalization layers was used, culminating in a dense output layer for binary classification. Cross-validation was performed with class weighting to handle imbalanced data. Model evaluation included confusion matrices and ROC curves, with visualizations of true and false predictions. To improve the model, data augmentation, deeper architectures, and transfer learning can be explored, along with enhanced evaluation metrics for better performance assessment.
